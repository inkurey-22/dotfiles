This is because:\n\n- **Two's complement representation:** In C, negative numbers are represented in two's complement. Simply flipping the sign bit does not always yield the positive equivalent, especially for `INT_MIN` (e.g., `-2147483648`), which does not have a positive counterpart in a 32-bit signed integer.\n- **Undefined behavior:** Manipulating the sign bit directly can lead to undefined behavior, especially if the result cannot be represented in the type.\n\nThe standard and safe way to make a number positive is to use `n = -n` or `n *= -1`, as you have in your code. This handles all cases except `INT_MIN`, which you already treat as a special case.\n\n**Summary:**  \nIt is not better to flip the first bit. Using arithmetic negation (`n = -n`) is the correct and portable way to make a negative number positive in C.",
